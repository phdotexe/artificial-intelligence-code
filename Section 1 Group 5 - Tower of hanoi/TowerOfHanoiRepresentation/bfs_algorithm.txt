Create an empty queue
Create an empty visited set
Create a parent map to reconstruct the solution
Enqueue the initial state
Mark the initial state as visited
While the queue is not empty:
    -Dequeue the front state
    -If the state is the goal, terminate
    -Generate all legal next states by applying valid moves
    -For each next state:
        -If not visited:
            -Mark visited
            -Record parent and move
            -Enqueue it
            -Reconstruct the solution path from goal to start
